# Vectors!!!!
# 1. Create variables for a ball that moves 
# You need a x-position, x-position
# also a x-speed and y-speed variable
# no need for a draw loop for now.
#
# 2. Convert the variables to PVector objects. 
#    Objects have:
#      attributes - info for specific object (i.e., location)
#      behaviours - things they can DO (methods like .add())
#
# 3. Get the ball to bounce along the border.
# 4. Get the mouse to attract the ball.
#      - create a new vector using the mouse 
#        location variables mouseX and mouseY.
#      - Use the PVector sub() method
#        https://processing.org/reference/PVector_sub_.html
#      - Print out the angle using the heading()
#        function. This prints out the angle in radians
#      - Use the degrees() function to convert radians to degrees.
